    	<p>Hi there, I see you found my website! My name is Conor Edmonds. I will be attending Michigan State University to earn my Master of Science in Marketing Research starting in Fall '18. While I studied Marketing and Advertising during my undergrad, I also got minors in German and Information Technology. I do love learning about cosumer behavior and market analytics, but I also love to learn new things I can do with a little bit of code. While this and more can be found on my resume, I wanted to use this page to share more about what makes me who I am: my interests, hobbies, and more. </p>

    	<p>I am half American, half English. My dad was born and grew up in England and most of his side of the family lives there. I have visited the country several times and would love to one day live and work there and around Europe for a few years.</p>

    	<p>I may study marketing and advertising, but one of my passions is graphic design. I started dabbling in design way back in middle school on forums using opensource software like GIMP; today, I use Adobe Creative Cloud products like Illustrator and Photoshop. I draw inspiration from the retro-futurism of the 1960's, the flat, material minimalism of today, and Wes Anderson. I also created all the graphics for this website!</p>

    	<p>I collect vinyl records from bands I love or albums with very unique covers. Some of those bands include the Beatles, the Strokes, Vampire Weekend, and Childish Gambino.</p>

    	<p>I love dogs! Okay, so I know I'm not at all unique for this, but I'll take any opportunity I get to show off my beautiful dog, Chloe. She's Chow-Black Lab mix.</p>

    	<p>In addition to vinyl and patterned socks, I also collect bottlecaps. It started out as a little joke between me and my friend stemming off the Fallout game series, but my collection is over 3,200 strong today.</p>

    	<p>I love games of all kinds, from video games to board games, but above all I love Dungeons and Dragons. The creativity and improvization it evokes are matched by few other activities. I've only been playing for a few years, so my list of characters isn't as long as some others, but that list includes a Wood Elf Rogue, an Aasimar Paladin, and a Water Genasi Sorceror.</p>

    	<p>To go along with my love of Dungeons and Dragons and the creativity it brings, I'm also an avid worldbuilder. I am currently in the act of crafting a world to immerse others in, Iotera. It is another great creative outlet and has helped me hone my writing, artisic, and creative thinking skills to create a truly capitivating world.</p>
